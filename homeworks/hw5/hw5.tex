{\bf Problem 1}  

Let $U = [U_0,~U_1,~\ldots,~U_m]^T$ be a vector of function values at
equally spaced points on the interval $0\leq x \leq 1$, and suppose the
underlying function is periodic and smooth.  Then we can approximate 
the first derivative $u_x$ at all of these points by $DU$, where $D$ is
circulant matrix such as
\[
D_- = \frac 1 h \brm 1&&&&-1\\ -1&1\\ &-1&1\\ &&-1&1\\ &&&-1&1\erm,  \qquad
D_+ = \frac 1 h \brm -1&1\\ &-1&1\\ &&-1&1\\ &&&-1&1\\ 1&&&&-1\erm
\]
for first-order accurate one-sided approximations or
\[
D_0 = \frac 1 {2h} \brm 0&1&&&-1\\ -1&0&1\\ &-1&0&1\\ &&-1&0&1\\ 1&&&-1&0\erm
\]
for a second-order accurate centered approximation.  (These are illustrated
for a grid with $m+1=5$ unknowns and $h=1/5$.)


The advection equation $u_t + au_x=0$ on the interval $0\leq x \leq
1$ with periodic boundary conditions  
gives rise to the MOL discretization $U'(t) = -aDU(t)$
where $D$ is one of the matrices above.

\begin{enumerate} 
\item Discretizing $U' = -aD_-U$ by forward Euler gives the first order
upwind method
\[
U_j^{n+1} = U_j^n - \frac{ak}{h} (U_j^n - U_{j-1}^n),
\]
where the index $i$ runs from 0 to $m$ with addition of indices performed
mod $m+1$ to incorporate the periodic boundary conditions.

Suppose instead we discretize the MOL equation by the second-order Taylor
series method, 
\[
U^{n+1} = U^n - akD_-U^n + \half (ak)^2 D_-^2 U^n.
\]
Compute $D_-^2$ and also write out the formula for $U_j^n$ that results from
this method.  

\item How accurate is the method derived in part (a) compared to the
Beam-Warming method, which is also a 3-point one-sided method?

\item Suppose we make the method more symmetric:
\[
U^{n+1} = U^n - \frac{ak}{2} (D_+ +D_-)U^n + \half (ak)^2 D_+D_- U^n.
\]
Write out the formula for $U_j^n$ that results from this method.  
What standard method is this?

{\bf Problem 2}  


\begin{enumerate} 
\item
Produce a plot similar to those shown in Figure 10.1 for the upwind method
(10.21) with the same values of $a=1$, $h=1/50$ and $k=0.8h$
used in that figure.

\item Produce the corresponding plot if the one-sided method (10.22) is
instead used with the same values of $a,~h$, and $k$ as in part (a).
Comment on how this relates to what stability theory tells you about this
method with these parameters.

{\bf Problem 3}  

The notebook \verb+notebooks/JSAnimation_demo.ipynb+ explains how the 
functions in the file \\
\verb+notebooks/JSAnimation_frametools.py+ can be
used to create animations of a time-dependent solution.  Using these requires
the package \verb+JSAnimations+, which is already available if you are using
SageMathCloud or the Anaconda installation on another computer for example.
You could also install it if necessary from this repository, 
\url{https://github.com/jakevdp/JSAnimation}, which contains
more details and other examples.

If you want to use the utility functions from a different directory, e.g.
\verb+hw5+, you should copy the file
\verb+notebooks/JSAnimation_frametools.py+ 
to that directory so that you can import it properly.

If you cannot get JSAnimation working, you can do this homework
without making animations, but it's a cool tool you might want to
use for other purposes.

The notebook \verb+notebooks/Lax-Wendroff_periodic.ipynb+ 
implements the Lax-Wendroff method for advection with periodic boundary
conditions.  Familiarize yourself with how this works by experimenting with
different parameter choices.  In particular understand how the periodic
boundary conditions are implemented.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Create a modified notebook that implements the Beam-Warming method from
Section 10.4.2.  Check that you observe second order accuracy.  Make sure you
implement the correct version based on the sign of $a$.  (A more general code
might take $a$ as an input parameter and implement both versions with some
logic to decide which to use, but you don't need to do this.)

\item
Experiment with different stepsizes to test the expected stability limit
of this method.  (And modify the warning message that is printed to warn of
instability, since the limit is different than for Lax-Wendroff!)
Produce plots for cases just below and just above the stability limit.  What
happens if it the time step is chosen to be right at the stability limit?  Why?

\item
Do the oscillations that develop trail behind the Gaussian peak or lead ahead
of it?  You should be able to observe both cases depending on how you choose
the time step.  Confirm that what you see agrees with what is expected 
from Example 10.11, and produce sample plots for each case.
