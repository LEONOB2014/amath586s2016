Code and notebooks
==================

Matlab scripts to accompany the book 
------------------------------------

See `the book webpage <http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/fdmbook/>`_

Jupyter notebooks
-----------------

The list of notebooks below contains links to versions you can view online
via `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/>`_.  (Check out this link and
also the `gallery
<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks>`_
for lots of cool examples of notebooks and books/papers written in this format.)

If you want to modify something in a notebook and re-execute, you will need
to download the notebook (or find it in the :ref:`class_repos`, in the `codes`
directory).

You will need a recent version of Jupyter in order to run an `Jupyter
notebook <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
See also :ref:`software`.

Notebooks can be found in `$AM586/codes/` if you want to run the notebook.  

If you want to easily run notebooks without installing any software, you
might try :ref:`smc`.
