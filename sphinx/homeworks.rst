Homework format
---------------

Homework should be submitted online via the 
`Canvas page <https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1038268/assignments>`_.

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  (See :ref:`biblio_latex`
for some references).  If necessary you can hand write and scan, but
typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice.

You can also write analytical solutions in a Jupyter notebook if
you wish to, which makes it particularly easy to mix analysis with
code illustrations.  

If you use a notebook, please submit both the `.ipynb` file and the
`.html` or `.pdf` file that is generated via the `Files --> Download as...` 
menu, or with the `ipython nbconvert` command.  If you use
a Python script, please submit the `.py` file.

For computer code, please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when
appropriate.  Include appropriate figures in your writeup.
